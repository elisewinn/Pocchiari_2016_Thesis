Since 2005, she has operated her own beauty salon. Currently the beauty stock of the salon is almost depleted. Therefore, Kaneez would like to purchase a variety of new cosmetic products to continue her business. \r\n\r\nAs a member of a four-person borrowing group, Kaneez has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase beauty products such as facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors and other products. She would also like to buy some new chairs for her salon. \r\n\r\nWith the profits she earns, she plans to extend her business by opening an additional beauty salon. She dreams of living a happy, healthy and peaceful life with her family.

","en":"Ahliddin is 46 years old. He lives in the northern part of Tajikistan with his family. He's married to a very nice woman; together they have four children. While his wife stays at home and takes care of the kids, Ahliddin runs a cattle ranching business. He's had this business, which is located in a very convenient place, for the past 11 years. Ahliddin is familiar with all the nuances of his business, so he's able to complete his job easily and be very satisfied with his work. \r\n\r\nNow, he's trying to expand his business and is, therefore, asking for a loan of 2000 soms, which will enable him to purchase some heads of cattle. This will increase his working capital and will allow him to achieve higher profits. With these profits, he'd like to purchase a television, something his children have been asking for a long time. He's hoping for your help.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nFamily has three milk cows. The cows are milked every day to make cheese and sell it locally at the markets, to get a small daily income. Their additional income is Mamuka\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension. <p>\r\n\r\nMamuka requested loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved by the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  Start-up loan program involves providing business start-up and re-startup credit, with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.  With the credit Mamuka will purchase a truck.  He wants to start working on private orders to transport a variety of cargo.  This will help him to earn additional income for the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of their family.

Her husband is a seasoning mixer in a Japanese restaurant, but his income is not large enough to pay all of the family's expenses.  Five years ago, Sri decided to help her husband by going into the business of selling clothes on credit. She sells school uniforms, jeans, blouses, and various kinds of veils.

Unfortunately, Yanneth lost her mother when she was very young; since then she has devoted all of her effort toward moving ahead in life with her family.  She is a very hard-working, happy and enthusiastic person.  She was not able to study for a professional career because from a very young age it was necessary that she work, but she would have really liked to study dressmaking.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, with much determination and dedication, Yanneth works as a singer of folkloric music.  She livens up parties and gatherings.  Yanneth rehearses her music every day and prepares her outfits.

She is pictured here with her hand raised and is the featured member of Sarah Group. Their group is 13 strong and all of the group members belong to a tribal community. The group members share the same thoughts and analogous principles. This is the binding force to carry on with their activity and leads them in development.\r\n\r\nLily says that starting a business in a place like where she lives is difficult. She also adds that the lack of demand for woven products, a bigger market and low capital paralyze her business activities. Lily used to weave to supplement the family income but stopped after she experienced a backache because of the back straps she used for weaving.  Lily now raises pigs and sells them when fully grown in the village and nearby villages. Lily makes more money with the piggery than she made when she used to weave. She decided to expand her piggery and raise pigs full time.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Lily is planning to buy more piglets and more feed. Her aspiration to own a large piggery farm can be accomplished if she is successful with her planning. Lily believes that her piggery business will immensely improve the financial condition of the family.  The rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, a piggery, poultry, a paan shop and animal husbandry. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1327122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy more piglets to expand her pig raising business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-04-10T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-10T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akhubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lunneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhojang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roslin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaknei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sennu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T02:00:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":546264,"name":"Ameera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ameera is a 49-year-old hardworking woman.

For the past 2 years she has been selling soft drinks, cold water, biscuits, cookies, and juice in the local market. The problem she faces is sometimes slow business. Most of the time she realizes profit and she uses it to sustain her family. She is requesting a loan to purchase more soft drinks, cold water, biscuits, cookies, and juice.

Janet is 20 years old and lives in the town of Bombo in the Luwero region of Uganda. She is married and has three children with two of them currently in school. For the past two years, Janet has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soap, sugar, milk and bread. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Janet has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential goods like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Janet to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Janet hopes that in the future she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nJanet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1328453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Rose has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food such as cassava, sweet potatoes, and fresh vegetables to sell, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and buy her children new clothes and bed sheets for her home. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He also grows crops to supplement the family's income, mainly wheat and potatoes. Uktam's wife helps him with the farm. They have seven children together and Uktam is a good father to them all. Uktam has always dreamed to go to college but his family circumstances prevented that. Last year he was able to send his eldest daughter to university in the capital of Dushanbe. Uktam hopes to be able to send all of his children to college. He also wants his children to have good living conditions at home. Uktam needs to repair his house, but he has sent all of his savings to pay for his daughter's education in Dushanbe. That is why Uktam is requesting a loan of 5000 somoni which he will use to purchase building materials to repair his house. He awaits your kindess.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1328899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Sherzod is married but has no children. For more then five years he has been running a taxi service so that his family has a higher monthly income. His wife Dildora raises cattle as the two live in a remote region of Tajikistan optimal for ranching. Sherzod hopes to become a father and so strives to expand his business and raise his profits so that he can create a good home for his future children. Recently he repaired his taxi cab and used all of his savings for that. Now his car is in good condition and his clients are happy with it. However, Sherzod has to organize an event\/party but has no more savings left for it. That is why he is requesting a loan of 1500 dollars. He hopes for your kindess.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1328913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer

She is married and has a young son. She lives with her husband and son at her in-laws' house. Her works consists of selling sweet treats; she sells her products door-to-door, and also has, on occasion, sold them from home, where she displays them on a table. She sells products such as sweets, cookies and gum. She is well-known for her charisma and sunny disposition, which have helped her sell her products and thus gather the economic revenue that she needs. She started this line of work 5 years ago as she wanted to be independent and to help with the family's daily expenses. When she first started her business, she felt very shy to be doing this kind of work; but with time, she was able to develop the personal qualities called for and she now generates a lot of sales and is very happy to do so. What she likes best about her work is talking with clients and getting them to laugh; she thinks the most difficult part of the business is having to sell when it is very hot outside.

Most of them started to leave when they were very young, even migrating to Argentina, in search of better living conditions.  As he was the oldest brother left, he started when he was very little to help his father with the farming and the dairy cows.  Therefore, he did not finish high school.  \n\nAt his older siblings\u2019 insistence, he even went for a few years to Argentina.  However, upon his father\u2019s death he had to return to Bolivia and start a new life with his future wife.  Taking advantage of the land he inherited from his father, he decided to work as a farmer and milk producer.  \n\nUpon noticing that there is a great demand for this product, he is prepared to invest and devote himself exclusively to this field.  However, he needs a little more capital.  He will use the loan to buy two head of dairy cows from his brother who wants to sell them because he is

She is 58 years old and originally from the town of Zitacuaro. She works with a group of people who apply for loans as a group to improve their businesses. The group is called \"Flores Magon,\" and the name of the group comes from the area in which many of the members live. Teresa sews items by request and makes alterations such as fixing hems, putting in zippers and\/or buttons. She makes blouses, pants, skirts, shorts, and shirts, as well as items such as curtains and sheets, etc. Teresa has run her business out of her home for the past 5 years. She took a course on making clothing through a program of her local government, and learned how to make alterations. In colder weather, Teresa makes knitted sweaters, hats, scarves, gloves, capes, and knitted blouses. In warmer weather, such as now, she is taking orders for blouses from thin fabrics and capri pants. Teresa is asking for this loan in order to buy fabrics of different colors and textures, thread, yarns, hooks, buttons, zippers, needles, etc. She says that this loan will help her very much with her business by allowing her to complete several requested orders and by having the capital that will make her able to offer items for sale to her clients. The other members of the group are called Mar\u00eda Socorro, Reyna, Clementina, Stephanie, Patricia, Roc\u00edo, Vianey, Carol Paola, Norma, Mercedes, Rosa Elena, and Jazm\u00edn.

She is from a city that is full of art, although it is not very well known. Since she was little she liked art, drawing and creatively observing any surroundings. Her primary school wasn't very good, since she had to travel from town to town due to violence. She stopped drawing for awhile and started to worry more because there wasn't anything to eat. She is displaced from a sparsely populated town where the guerillas rule and has taken refuge with her mother and two siblings in an old house with no utilities. The violence hasn't made them them leave there. \r\n\r\nThat was when she started to like less realistic drawings with mysterious details. When she was little she she didn't feel it was abnormal to run from one place to another or to hide or have no financial stability. To the contrary, she thought it was all an adventure or at least she wouldn't show any sadness. It was something that she was raised with and these unlucky events taught them how to be good people. They personally determined that they would keep whatever good thing each event would show. Her story is long and she has lived a lot for her age, but this is just a chapter that will be seen and from that her biggest wishes and dreams are to express her life in an artistic and adventurous way.\r\n\r\nShe would like to give her thanks in advance for the support offered and for your attention.

She wants Kiva to give her this big help because at this time she has no financial stability. It has become a little difficult to pay for college since she has to help her mother with the household responsibilities. Her mother doesn't have a job because she is elderly and it is very difficult to find her one, especially since she doesn't have much experience. For these reasons the payment has been a little difficult but when she found out about this agreement she was very happy. This is an opportunity that is seldom seen. In addition her eagerness to get ahead has given her more strength to not ignore her studies and keep fighting for her dreams. Sometimes you feel defeated by things that happen but God helps everyday to have more strength and get up eager to keep fighting for her goals. She also has the encouragement that her mother gives her. It's because of her that she is studying to get her ahead so she can make her proud and have a calm life. You have to have a humble and simple life. That is how we will be great human beings professionally, at work, and spiritually. Never stop fighting and showing the world that you want to get ahead.

Right now, he urgently needs to improve the wall and roof of his home, which is why he decided to visit Ceprodel to ask for a loan to buy construction materials.

The interior has recently undergone a nice renovation, and it is ready to reopen with freshly painted walls and a welcoming, pleasant atmosphere. Her current assets in the project are app. 27,000 dollars, and she has been able to hire three women as her employees to work in the center in various functions.\n\nTo complete the refurbishment of the center Hannah would like to buy some additional equipment to better accommodate her customers' needs during busy hours in the gym. She plans to buy treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes. Based on her plans, she applied for a SME loan* from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. Hannah sees the investment providing her with a 7% increase in her income. \n\nHannah is not only a great businesswoman, she is a wife and mother and a role model for many in her community. \n\n*Relief International Microfinance Iraq provides qualified clients with a loan product specifically tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises (or SMEs).

 She is a Khmer noodle seller in the local area. She has been making  a living in this business for 20 years and is able to earn up to 28,900 KHR per day.

Her mother lived with him after the baby was born but five years later they got divorced because of his bad behavior.  He did not feed them and was abusive.  Her mother decided give herself another opportunity for love and she took her daughter to live with another man who apparently loved them.  After six long years of living with this man, his bad intentions toward her made life impossible, so at age 13 she decided to live her own life with the support of her maternal grandmother.  In a small city, it is not the age that matters but rather the determination to work, so this is why she left school and started to work.  She lasted a year doing this while recovering from the harm this man had caused her, in matters of clothing, text books, and shoes, among other things.  After that she decided to go back to school to finish the two years she needed for high school (10th and 11th grades).  She used the money she had earned to buy supplies and uniforms and pay for tuition.  Her boss allowed her to quit work at 6:00 p.m. so that she could go to school at 6:30 p.m.  She was able to study and work for six months, but her boss finally said she was leaving too early at a job that was supposed to last all day.\r\n\r\nShe continued her studies with the help of her grandmother and finished high school successfully.  She moved to another city in 2006 at age 16 and wanted to work but it was more complicated than in her town.  But she was able to get a job through a friend who had a small hat and belt business.  There she met the person who is now her husband and they began a nice relationship.  She always wanted to continue studying because she felt that was the only way to get ahead.  She began secretarial studies at an academy but had to quit because she got pregnant and it was a high risk pregnancy.  She set up house with the father of her daughter and began to take care of the home and could not continue studying due to financial reasons.  Nor could she work because of the baby (who is now five years old).  Thankfully, she is studying again through much effort because it is difficult for three people to live off of one income.  But she knows it is a great investment for their lives because there will be more well-paid work on offer.

Continuing with the story, Giovanny doesn't have any kind of financial support right now.  However, he doesn't want to lose the opportunity that he worked so hard for (the opportunity to study).  Going to university has been of paramount importance to him since he left school in 2008 because he knows that if he studies he will go far in life.  Giovanny wants to become a successful systems engineer because it is what he is passionate about.  He does not want all his hard work to have been in vain."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1329147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Together, they live in a wooden house.  From a young age, she was taught different agricultural tasks and work related to the production of cacao and organic coffee, this being the main livelihood of her family.  As the years passed and she married her husband, she was able to become independent through the support of her parents; they offered her an inheritance of some plots of land for the maintenance of her own family.  \r\n\r\nShe had been in this business for almost four years, but in having a young daughter, she decided to start a small business selling carbonated drinks, snacks, and other items, near a court where people play sports in her neighborhood.  She hopes that her neighbors will be her main customer base.  In this way, she hopes to put in the effort now in order to achieve a better quality of life in the long-run, her final objective being to open a larger foods store.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva, which she says is a good tool for work.

She has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase chairs and some required furniture for her tuition center. She wants to increase the seating capacity so she can teach more children in one room and her monthly income could be increased.

She has two children.  Her eldest, Javier, is 17 years old.  Last year, for financial reasons, she was unable to enroll him in college.  He is currently at home.  With faith and hard work, she hopes that he will be able to start university next semester.  Diana's other son, Oscar, is 4 years old.   He is in pre-school and, thanks to God, he is receiving an education.\r\n\r\nDiana works as a carer in family homes, looking after adults.  However, the work is sporadic.  She lives in a rented apartment and covers all the household expenses herself.  The family don't have any luxuries, nor can Diana give her children things they ask for, but she tries to give them what she can within her means.  They have to miss out on a lot of things and, if they really want something, Diana has to make sacrifices.\r\n\r\nDiana is currently studying in the hopes that she will be able to get ahead and provide a better quality of life for her children and her mother.  Diana's mother, Rocio, is 56 years old.  Owing to her age, Rocio is out of work.  She was a nurse's aide with SENA (the Colombian National Learning Service) but, as a result of her age, the way society is and institutional protocols, she is no longer able to work.  Instead, Rocio helps out with the children while Diana goes out to work and attends college.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Diana separated from her husband because of domestic abuse.  She no longer has any contact with her children's father and he does not help out financially.  Diana has done her best.  This agreement will help her a lot as she will need to help her eldest son with transportation costs when he starts studying in June and she also has household expenses to cover.  Thankfully, the Institution provided the opportunity to attend classes.  She started a little late, when classes had already begun, but thanks to the interest she showed, she is now ahead in her studies and receiving good grades.  She hopes to continue in this way right up until graduation day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1329139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to complete her studies as a nurse's aide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":151448.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197716},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":151448.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891043},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":75724.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912452},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":75724.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391557685}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T14:43:26Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":546562,"name":"Shakeela Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shakeela is a 39-year-old diligent and hardworking woman.

She is married and has 1 child, age 11 yrs. Mariama has 2 younger sisters who live with her to assist in running her business. In 1998, she established her textiles business. She began her business at an early age with her mother. It was the only activity the family depended on. There was nothing else that could bring income into the home because of the ideology that girl children are not meant for school, but only to be at their marital homes. She was convinced of the concept and decided to be in line with the family. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business.

married to Filder.  Together they have four children with whom they share many family experiences in their own home, acquired through the fruit of their efforts.  Her work is the production of cocoa and organic coffee, work which she does in her own parcel of land. The country provided a great opportunity to get her start independently.  With the birth of her first son, it was necessary to look for a steady source of income for the economic development of her family.  \r\n\r\nFrida can always count on the support of her husband in the respective tasks needed to ensure high-quality production.  The only way to obtain good production is through the quality of the cocoa pods, which are evaluated by purchasers from the region.

El nombre del grupo lo eligieron  porque en la comunidad donde viven hay un banco donde se extrae la piedra la cual se utiliza para construcci\u00f3n de las viviendas.\nTere quien es integrante del grupo cuenta que tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad vive en uni\u00f3n libre con Iv\u00e1n desde hace siete a\u00f1os  quien es alba\u00f1il, juntos han formado una familia con un ni\u00f1o que se encuentra estudiando su educaci\u00f3n primaria. Tere se dedica a la venta de productos de belleza desde hace cinco a\u00f1os, Tere comenta \"Inicie con la venta de mis productos de belleza porque una se\u00f1ora venia a mi casa a ofrecerme los mismos cosm\u00e9ticos y ropa, esta misma persona fue quien me motivo para iniciar con mi propio negocio\". Adem\u00e1s, es una actividad que le permite a Tere estar con su ni\u00f1o sin tener que descuidarlo por mucho tiempo por lo que tambi\u00e9n puede ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de su hijo. Tere pl\u00e1tica que en las tardes y cuando est\u00e1 en sus ratos libres visita a sus vecinas para poder ofrecerle  sus productos para tambi\u00e9n mostrarles sus folletos.

They selected this name for their group because in the community where they live, there is a bank where the people extract stone; they then use this stone to construct their homes.\n\nTeresa is the featured member of this group.  She is twenty-eight years old and has lived in a common-law marriage with Iv\u00e1n for seven years.  Iv\u00e1n is a bricklayer.  Together, they have formed a family with one son; he is studying in primary school.  Tere has made a living in selling beauty products for five years.  She says: \"I began selling beauty products because a woman came to my house and offered me these same cosmetics and clothes.  This same person was the individual who motivated me to start my own business.\"  Furthermore, this activity allows Tere to be with her son without having to leave him alone for a lot of time.  She is also able to help her husband with the home expenses and with her son's education.  Tere says that in the afternoons and in her free moments, she visits with her female neighbors in order to offer them her products and to also show them her brochures.  \n\nThis time, Tere is requesting a loan in order to buy more cosmetics and perfumes that her clients have requested.  The only difficulty that Tere deals with is when some clients get behind with their payments; this makes it hard for her to be able to cover her own payments that she makes every two weeks.  From there on out, it's nothing too serious.\n\nThis doesn't prevent Tere from having dreams: \"One day, I want my son to finish his studies for a profession that he likes and that will allow him to have a better quality of life.\"  She knows that in order to achieve this, she has to have a higher income, since her son wants to study computer science.  She will do this through her business.\n\nTere has goals, just like the rest of the group members.  For this reason, they are requesting a loan from the institution in order to invest in their businesses: Mario and Mar\u00eda Alberta will invest in their grocery stores; Laura, Francisca, Rosa, and Basilia will invest in raising and fattening lambs.  They are very happy and thankful to Vision Fund and to Kiva for the loan that has been offered to them.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6650,"image":{"id":1322880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":6650,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":82000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":10250},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10250},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10250},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":10250},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10250},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10250},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2493.75,"local_amount":30750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-30T09:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30757.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663565},{"amount":1662.5,"local_amount":20500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":20504.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048979},{"amount":1662.5,"local_amount":20500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20504.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840148},{"amount":831.25,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10252.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698476}],"funded_date":"2013-04-13T01:29:13Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":544272,"name":"Cuna De Belen Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \"Cuna de Belen\" se encuentra en una comunidad muy bonita que se identifica por sus grandes tradiciones los integrantes del grupo platican que la fiesta mas grande de la comunidad es el 2 de febrero dia de la Candelaria es una fiesta catolica donde la mayoria de las personas se reunen para celebrar esta virgen.

She has been married for 27 years to Miguel who works as a laborer. Together they have six children, but only two are still dependent. Feliza has been raising pigs for 27 years. She says, \u201cI started raising pigs when my husband wasn't working and all of our children were in school. We had many expenses so I wanted to help my husband with the household expenses.\u201d \nFeliza is requesting a loan to buy feed for her piglets so they can continue their healthy growth. She says that she buys piglets when they are very small and raises and fattens them to sell. Her neighbors generally check in with her to find out when her pigs are developed enough to sell.

She has a lovely family: a husband and a nine-year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s always enjoyed studying.  Her parents, Joaqu\u00edn and Patricia, gave her the opportunity to attend elementary and high school problem-free and she has very pleasant memories of those days like being a very good student, of participating in various sports activities, in dances, in the marching band, etc.  Despite her parents being separated, they always instilled in her very important values like the appreciation for everything life can provide for her.  She continued her studies and took the admission tests for the Autonomous University to continue a professional career in dentistry where she was successful and was able to start her studies like she wanted to.  However, as life is wont to do, there were highs and lows.  Her mother, who was head of household with four children and provided economically for her studies, was unable to continue doing so and she had to drop out of the dentistry program.\r\n\r\nLater on with her own income earned at work she took a series of courses to be able to improve her work and academic profiles.  Caterine never stopped aiming at finishing her studies leading to a professional degree so like many others she works hard alongside her husband in order to be able to study financial accounting.  She knows that little by little, climbing up step by step, one reaches the summit and that with support from her family and the effort she herself puts into it her dream will finally become reality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things for Caterine is to show her daughter and many others that age and having children is no obstacle to reach one\u2019s goals.\r\n\r\nShe knows that with the passage of time and with the experience years provides one can focus more seriously and responsibly on what one's priorities are today which besides her family are to attain her professional degree not in her original choice of dentistry perhaps but as an accountant specializing in finance which life and her life experiences have shown her to be what she\u2019s really good at.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, she\u2019s thankful for everything she\u2019s enjoyed in life and she does not regret anything she\u2019s done for it has all led to forming her character: responsibility, respect and conscience.\r\n\r\nCaterine only hopes to be in good health and to improve her economy and her work so that she can reach a new goal.  But this isn\u2019t the end; she believes she still has many dreams to reach and many goals to attain.

She must replace her merchandise continuously and her small quantities don't merit competitive prices. This is Judith's justification for approaching Kiva, to request her 1st financing through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. She wishes  to purchase sweets and primary goods such as wheat flour and other articles to use in preparing foods to sell.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Judith can augment her productivity for the potential market she anticipates and generate more income.
